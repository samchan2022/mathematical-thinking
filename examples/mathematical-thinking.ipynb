    "## 6. Understand the Underlying Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias and Unbiasedness\n",
    "- An estimator is unbiased if its expected value equals the parameter it estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "- The concept of degrees of freedom explains why we divide by $ N - 1 $ instead of $ N $ when calculating sample variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimator Properties\n",
    "- **Consistency**: An estimator is consistent if it converges to the true value as the sample size increases.\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: An estimator is efficient if it has the smallest variance among unbiased estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Generalize and Reflect\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generalization\n",
    "The principles of bias correction and degrees of freedom apply to other statistical estimators and problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "- The approach of understanding, breaking down, hypothesizing, testing, and formally analyzing is broadly applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Practice Similar Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variations\n",
    "Explore other types of estimators and their biases, and apply corrections as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deepening Intuition\n",
    "- Solve problems involving different estimators and sample sizes to build a strong intuitive understanding of statistical concepts.\n",
